Hello This is the README Document for my assignment.
So, in theory the program should compile for both maven and normal use, just like any other.
to compile for MVN
Currently there is a glitch in the pom.xml file that me and the teacher have been working on fixing so currently it
doesn't run correctly. But in theory this is how it would work.
"mvn compile" after putting the src into the correct place
"mvn package"

This would normally work to compile the code in maven

Outside of maven
javac src/main/java/org/cs362/dominion/PlayDominion.java

this should create a program that can be run.
