Project folder for Levi Willmeth, CS372 Winter 2017.

A few reminders for myself:

Run commands from projects/willmetl (where pom.xml lives)

mvn compile
mvn clean
mvn package
mvn test
mvn validate

Generate new code coverage report:
mvn cobertura:cobertura
Creates html files in target/site/cobertura

Should I be including my target/* files in the git repo? I kinda doubt it.. but leaving them in for now.
