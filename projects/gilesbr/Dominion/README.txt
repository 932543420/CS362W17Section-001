Dominion By Brennan Giles

Developed within Eclipse - if any issues arise contact me at gilesbr@oregonstate.edu

TestCard included which tests validity of card objects created

To be honest the instructions are very confusing, should I submit through canvas, the 
github...?

I worked for a very long time on this project and I'm still not sure if you guys
care more about the testing or the dominion program itself... I focused on the 
Program but if you want a more comprehensive test suite PLEASE let me know and I
can easily fix that.
