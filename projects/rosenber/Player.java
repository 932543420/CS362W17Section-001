/*
 * This class implements the functionality a player needs for a game
 * of Dominion. The player has full control over all of the cards in its
 * possession (hand, deck, etc). This puts all of the responsibility for
 * error handling on the player. The game must ask the player what they
 * would like to do, and the player will give. They are not responsible
 * for making sure their action is valid for the point in the game, only
 * for accessing the places in their hand and decks.
