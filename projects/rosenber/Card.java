/*
 * This class will implement a Super Card class for the cards in a game of
 * Dominion. The cards will hold all of the information that every card in
 * the game has. There are functions that will implement the specific
 * features of each card. If a card does not have one of those features,
 * the function should not be changed in the inherited class.
 * 	Example:
 *   - Dutchy has no action, it will not change the action function
 *   - A copper is worth no victory points, it will have 0 victory points
 *   - Etc
